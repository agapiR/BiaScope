* [Bar charts with Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/)
* [Scatterplots with Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/)
* [Projections with Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/t-sne-and-umap-projections/)
* [Dash Deployment with Heroku](https://dash.plotly.com/deployment)

Our Dash app is hosted on a free [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) instance.
